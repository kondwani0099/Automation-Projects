Automation Projects is a collection of smart applications that leverage Arduino, AI, computer vision, and natural language models to automate different parts of our lives. The project incorporates voice recognition and gesture control to control LEDs, relay switches, and servo motors using Python, MediaPipe, and Arduino.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Arduino Uno board
- 220 ohms resistors
- LEDs
- Relays
- Servo motors
- Arduino kit with various sensors
- Visual Studio Code (Online version) - [Download Online](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Python 3.11 - [Install Online](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-311/)
- Arduino IDE - [Download IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Installation

1. Connect the Arduino Uno board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Install Visual Studio Code (Online version) and Python 3.11.
3. Download and install the Arduino IDE to write Arduino code.

## Usage

The Automation Projects can be used for various applications, including:

- **Smart Home Application:** Control home appliances and lighting using voice commands and hand gestures.
- **Farming Automation:** Automate irrigation systems, weather monitoring, and livestock management.
- **Industrial Smart Automation:** Implement automation in manufacturing processes and monitoring systems.

## Voice Recognition

The smart application utilizes AI-based voice recognition to control LEDs, relay switches, and servo motors using voice commands. Users can trigger specific actions by speaking predefined voice commands.

## Gesture Control

The project incorporates computer vision with the help of MediaPipe to detect hand gestures and control LEDs, relay switches, and servo motors. Gestures like thumbs-up can turn on LEDs, while other gestures can trigger different actions.

## Pre-Installation

Before running the project, make sure to follow these steps:

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code (Online version).
2. Install Python 3.11 or later.
3. Download and install the Arduino IDE for writing Arduino code.
4. Purchase an Arduino kit with various sensors, 220 ohms resistors, LEDs, relays, servo motors, and an Arduino Uno board.
